            <p>A frog is any member of a diverse and 
                largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, 
                tailless amphibians composing the order Anura 
                (ανοὐρά, literally without tail in Ancient Greek). 
                The oldest fossil "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is 
                known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but 
                molecular clock dating suggests their split from 
                other amphibians may extend further back to the 
                Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely 
                distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic 
                regions, but the greatest concentration of species 
                diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account 
                for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are 
                also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. 
                Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the 
                distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not 
                from taxonomy or evolutionary history.</p></article>
