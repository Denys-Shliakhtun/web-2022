            <h4>Frogs</h4>
            <p>
                A <strong>frog</strong> is any member of a diverse and 
                largely carnivorous group of short-bodied, 
                tailless amphibians composing the order Anura 
                (ανοὐρά, literally without tail in Ancient Greek). 
                The oldest fossil "proto-frog" Triadobatrachus is 
                known from the Early Triassic of Madagascar, but 
                molecular clock dating suggests their split from 
                other amphibians may extend further back to the 
                Permian, 265 million years ago. Frogs are widely 
                distributed, ranging from the tropics to subarctic 
                regions, but the greatest concentration of species 
                diversity is in tropical rainforest. Frogs account 
                for around 88% of extant amphibian species. They are 
                also one of the five most diverse vertebrate orders. 
                Warty frog species tend to be called toads, but the 
                distinction between frogs and toads is informal, not 
                from taxonomy or evolutionary history.
            </p>

                An adult frog has a stout body, protruding eyes, 
                anteriorly-attached tongue, limbs folded underneath, 
                and no tail (the tail of tailed frogs is an extension 
                of the male cloaca). Frogs have glandular skin, with 
                secretions ranging from distasteful to toxic. Their 
                skin varies in colour from well-camouflaged dappled 
                brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red 
                or yellow and black to show toxicity and ward off predators. 
                Adult frogs live in fresh water and on dry land; some species 
                are adapted for living underground or in trees.

                Frogs typically lay their eggs in water. The eggs hatch 
                into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and 
                internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth 
                parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous 
                diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into 
                adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole 
                stage. Adult frogs generally have a carnivorous diet consisting 
                of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a 
                few feed on plant matter. Frog skin has a rich microbiome 
                which is important to their health. Frogs are extremely 
                efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. 
                They are an important food source for predators and part 
                of the food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. 
                The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to 
                dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have 
                special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. Frogs produce 
                a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding 
                season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviors 
                to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.
