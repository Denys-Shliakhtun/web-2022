                Frogs have no tail, except as larvae, and most have 
                long hind legs, elongated ankle bones, webbed toes, no 
                claws, large eyes, and a smooth or warty skin. They have 
                short vertebral columns, with no more than 10 free vertebrae 
                and fused tailbones (urostyle or coccyx).[42] Frogs range in 
                size from Paedophryne amauensis of Papua New Guinea that is 
                7.7 mm (0.30 in) in snout–to–vent length[43] to the up to 
                32 cm (13 in) and 3.25 kg (7.2 lb) goliath frog (Conraua 
                goliath) of central Africa.[44] There are prehistoric, 
                extinct species that reached even larger sizes.

                <h4><li>Feet and legs</li></h4>
                <p>
                    The structure of the feet and legs varies greatly among 
                    frog species, depending in part on whether they live primarily 
                    on the ground, in water, in trees, or in burrows. Frogs must 
                    be able to move quickly through their environment to catch 
                    prey and escape predators, and numerous adaptations help 
                    them to do so. Most frogs are either proficient at jumping 
                    or are descended from ancestors that were, with much of the 
                    musculoskeletal morphology modified for this purpose. The 
                    tibia, fibula, and tarsals have been fused into a single, 
                    strong bone, as have the radius and ulna in the fore limbs 
                    (which must absorb the impact on landing). The metatarsals 
                    have become elongated to add to the leg length and allow 
                    frogs to push against the ground for a longer period on 
                    take-off. The ilium has elongated and formed a mobile 
                    joint with the sacrum which, in specialist jumpers such 
                    as ranids and hylids, functions as an additional limb 
                    joint to further power the leaps. The tail vertebrae 
                    have fused into a urostyle which is retracted inside 
                    the pelvis. This enables the force to be transferred 
                    from the legs to the body during a leap.[42]

                <h4><li>Skin</li></h4>
                <p>
                    A frog's skin is protective, has a respiratory function, 
                    can absorb water, and helps control body temperature. 
                    It has many glands, particularly on the head and back, 
                    which often exude distasteful and toxic substances 
                    (granular glands). The secretion is often sticky 
                    and helps keep the skin moist, protects against 
                    the entry of moulds and bacteria, and make the 
                    animal slippery and more able to escape from 
                    predators.[53] The skin is shed every few weeks. 
                    It usually splits down the middle of the back and 
                    across the belly, and the frog pulls its arms and 
                    legs free. The sloughed skin is then worked towards 
                    the head where it is quickly eaten.[54]

                <h4><li>Respiration and circulation</li></h4>
                <p>
                    Like other amphibians, oxygen can pass through their highly permeable skins. This unique feature allows them to remain in places without access to the air, respiring through their skins. Ribs are generally absent, so the lungs are filled by buccal pumping and a frog deprived of its lungs can maintain its body functions without them.[62] The fully aquatic Bornean flat-headed frog (Barbourula kalimantanensis) is the first frog known to lack lungs entirely.[65]
                </p>
                <p>
                    Frogs have three-chambered hearts, a feature they share with lizards. Oxygenated blood from the lungs and de-oxygenated blood from the respiring tissues enter the heart through separate atria. When these chambers contract, the two blood streams pass into a common ventricle before being pumped via a spiral valve to the appropriate vessel, the aorta for oxygenated blood and pulmonary artery for deoxygenated blood.[66]
